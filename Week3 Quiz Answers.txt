An array of bytes
A CVPixelBuffer - Correct
Image class

Question 5

Copy values to input tensor, call interpreter.invoke(), copy outputs to output Tensor - Correct
interpreter.run(input, output)
Copy values to input tensor, call interpreter.run(), copy outputs to output Tensor
interpreter.invoke(input, output)

Question 6
How do you specify the number of threads that the interpreter should use?
Call the setThreads() method on an InterpreterOptions object and specify the desired amount
Use an InterpreterOptions object and set its threads property to the desired amount
Use an InterpreterOptions object and set it’s useThreads property to true
Use an InterpreterOptions object and set its threadCount property to the desired amount - Correct
