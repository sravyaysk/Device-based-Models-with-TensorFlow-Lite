Week 4 Quiz

Question 1
Which Devices support TensorFlow Lite for Inference? (Check all that apply)
Coral - Correct
RISC - Incorrect
Raspberry Pi - Correct
Sparkfun Edge - Correct

Question 2
With a Raspberry Pi, how can you use TensorFlow?
Inference Only
It doesn’t work on Pi
Training Only
Inference and Training - Correct

Question 3
If you only want to do inference on a Pi, what’s the best way?
Compile all of TensorFlow from Source and run it
Do nothing, the Pi base image has TensorFlow in it
Install the full TensorFlow with Pip install
Install the standalone interpreter using pip - Correct

Question 4
When using ImageNet on a Raspberry Pi for Image Classification, how many classes are supported?
800
100
500
1000 - Correct

Question 5
How do you initialize the standalone interpreter in Python?
tf.lite.load(lite_model)
tf.lite.Interpreter(directory_of_saved_model)
tf.lite.Interpreter(directory_of_lite_Model) - Correct
tf.lite.load(saved_model)

Question 6
How do you get the input tensors for a model with the standalone interpreter?
Call get_input_tensors() after calling allocate_tensors() on the interpreter
Call get_input_tensors() after initializing the interpreter
Call get_input_details() after initializing the interpreter
Call get_input_details() after calling allocate_tensors() on the interpreter - Correct
7.
Question 7
How do you perform inference using the interpreter?
Set the Input tensor with the set_tensor command and then call invoke() - Correct
Call invoke(), and pass it both the input and output tensors
Call invoke(), and pass it the input tensor
Just call invoke(), TensorFlow can do the rest

Question 8
How do you read the results of inference using the interpreter?
Call invoke(), pass it the input and output tensors, and then read the output tensor
Call invoke(), and then call get_tensor() on the interpreter to read the output - Correct
Call invoke(), and the the output will be rendered automatically
Call invoke(), pass it the input tensor, read the results
